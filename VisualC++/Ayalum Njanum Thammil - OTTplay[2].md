Ravi initially hated Samuel for his rigid and harsh attitude, and often disobeyed his orders. He also fell in love with Sainu, a nurse who worked in the hospital. Sainu was engaged to Vivek (Narain), a journalist who was away in Delhi. Ravi and Sainu had a secret affair, which was later discovered by Samuel. Samuel confronted Ravi and slapped him for his unethical behaviour. He also revealed that he knew Sainu from her childhood, as she was the daughter of his best friend who died in an accident. Samuel had promised to take care of Sainu and her mother, and had arranged her marriage with Vivek.
 
Ravi felt guilty and ashamed for betraying Samuel and Sainu. He decided to end his relationship with Sainu and focus on his career. He also started to respect and admire Samuel for his dedication and integrity. He learned many valuable lessons from Samuel, such as how to handle critical situations, how to deal with difficult patients, how to perform complex surgeries, and how to cope with failures and losses. He also witnessed Samuel's personal struggles, such as his loneliness, his alcoholism, his depression, and his terminal illness.
 
One day, Ravi was assigned to operate on a young boy who had a brain tumour. The boy's father was a local politician who threatened Ravi to save his son at any cost. Ravi performed the surgery successfully, but the boy died due to complications. The politician blamed Ravi for the death and filed a case against him. Ravi was suspended from the hospital and faced legal action. He was also ostracised by his colleagues and friends. He felt hopeless and suicidal.
 
Samuel came to Ravi's rescue and took him to his home. He consoled Ravi and told him that he was proud of him for doing his best. He also told him that he had lied to the medical council that he had performed the surgery instead of Ravi, in order to save him from the charges. He said that it was his last wish to see Ravi become a successful doctor like him. He then collapsed on the floor due to a heart attack.
 
Ravi rushed Samuel to the hospital and tried to revive him. However, Samuel died on the way. Ravi was devastated by Samuel's death and realised that he had lost his mentor and father figure.
 
The film then returns to the present day, where Ravi is found by the police in a remote village. He is arrested and taken back to the city. He faces a trial for the girl's death, where he is defended by Diya (Rima Kallingal), a lawyer who is also Vivek's sister.
 
Diya argues that Ravi had performed the surgery with good intentions and without any negligence or malpractice. She also presents evidence that the girl had a rare blood disorder that caused her death, which was not detected by the hospital's lab tests.
 
The court acquits Ravi of all charges and praises him for his courage and professionalism. The girl's father apologises to Ravi for his mistake and thanks him for trying to save his daughter.
 
Ravi walks out of the court with Diya, who tells him that she has fallen in love with him. She also tells him that Sainu is married to Vivek and has a daughter named Mary.
 
Ravi smiles and hugs Diya, accepting her love. He also sees Sainu outside the court with her family. They exchange a glance of gratitude and farewell.
 
The film ends with Ravi returning to his hospital, where he is welcomed by his colleagues and patients. He resumes his work as a cardiac surgeon, following Samuel's footsteps.
